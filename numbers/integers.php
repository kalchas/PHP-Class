	 * The term integer is pretty self explanatory. It refers to a whole number (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) or its opposite. The number of
	 * places possible is dependent upon the operating system being used. PHP will generally take care of converting between
	 * integers and floating point numbers as needed (i.e., if there's an overflow, PHP will cast the int as a float).
