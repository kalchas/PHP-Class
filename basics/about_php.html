	<h1>What is PHP?</h1>
	<p>PHP is a scripted server side language. The name is an auto referential acronym, standing for "PHP, Hypertext Preprocessor." PHP is fast, easy to learn and widely available.</p>
	<p>Because PHP is a server side language, it does not execute any code in a browser (the language of the browser is, generally speaking, Javascript). PHP can, however, give Javascript, HTML and CSS to the browser to work with. In fact, this is how PHP is most commonly used: as an intermediary between a back-end database and a front-end web application.</p>
	<p>Modern versions of PHP may be deployed from the command line as well as by a web server, but PHP is most often run on a web server, and that server is most frequently Apache.</p>
